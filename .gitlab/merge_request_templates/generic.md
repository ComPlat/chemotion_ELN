  
- [ ] rather 1-story 1-commit than sub-atomic commits
- [ ] commit title is meaningful =>  git history search
- [ ] commit description is helpful => helps the reviewer to understand the changes
- [ ] code is up-to-date with the latest developments of the target branch (rebased to it or whatever) => :fast_forward:-merge for linear history is favoured
- [ ] added code is linted
- [ ] tests are passing (at least locally): we still have some random test failure on CI. thinking of asking spec/examples.txt to be commited
- [ ] in case the changes are visible to the end-user,  video or screenshots should be added to the PR => helps  with user testing
- [ ] testing coverage improvement is more than welcome.
- [ ] CHANGELOG :  add a bullet point on top (optional: reference to github issue/PR )
- [ ] (parallele PR for documentation  on docusaurus  if the feature/fix is tagged for a release)
